    <P>Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a <U><strong>Nonsense Text.</strong></U> “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,”<br/> Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”</P>

    <P><strong>Richard McClintock</strong>, a Latin scholar from <u>Hampden-Sydney College</u>, is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text.<br/> In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word.<br/>Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum <i>(“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”)</i>, a first-century B.C. text from the <u>Roman philosopher Cicero.</u></P><br/>
